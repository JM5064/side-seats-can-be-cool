Based on the image, here is the text that is legible:

**On the wall sign (top right):**
*   **Safe Point** (in red text)
*   **Comfortable**
*   **Quiet**
*   **Safe space**
*   **Conversations**
*   **encouraged**

There are other signs visible on the blue door and the surrounding walls, but the text on them is too small or blurry to be read clearly.
